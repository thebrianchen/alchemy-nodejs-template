# Alchemy NodeJs Starter Templates

This repo contains a barebones starter template using the Alchemy SDK. To get started, go into the directory of your target language and run:
```
npm install
npm dev
```

This will run the sample node script in `src/index.js` or `src/index.ts`.

This also includes a formatter preconfigured that you can run with:
```
npm run format
```
